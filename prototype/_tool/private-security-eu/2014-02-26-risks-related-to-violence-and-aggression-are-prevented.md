**Violence/aggression against private security guards** may come in many guises:

  * verbal violence: insults, threats
  * physical violence: being struck or being injured
  * by weapons or by giving the impression of being armed
  * ...

These acts of violence may cause **physical injuries** but have also a
negative effect on private security guards' **psychological** health (such as
feelings of fear and post-traumatic stress). Private security guards, being
**witness** to a violent act, may as well suffer from psychological trauma.

Security jobs that involve **contact with the public** (e.g. surveillance in
shopping centres or areas with a high through-flow of people such as railway
and metro stations, detection of shoplifting) are more exposed to physical
violence.

**Check the following issues **(in agreement with the client if and when necessary)

  * All existing security measures should be considered (coded doors, bolting entries, cameras,...).
  * Quick communication should be possible if a problem arises (telephone, radio, alarm buttons, etc.).
  * The number of lone working private security guards should be kept to a minimum and, if this proves impossible, it should be ensured that the worker has a means of constant contact with the private security company.
  * Staff should be trained in handling conflict situations.
  * Post-incident care should be provided.
