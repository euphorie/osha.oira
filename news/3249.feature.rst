OiRA Matomo: Add tracking snippet.

This tracking snippet deactivates automatic link tracking for the report
download buttons and tracks them manually.
It removes the session id segment from the URL so that all downloads can be
grouped together in Matomo and to not reveal DSGVO relevant data.

Also:

- Load dimensions from server.
- Track after location change.
- Implement custom link tracking.
- Remove all session ids from any URLs, including current URL and referrer URL.

Note: This does not add the tracking snippet to the portal automatically, but
only provides the code to add it manually through-the-web.
