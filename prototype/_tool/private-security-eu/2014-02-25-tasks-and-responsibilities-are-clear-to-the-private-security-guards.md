Private security guards have legally only one hierarchical line, i.e. with
their employers and representatives. In the exercise of their duties, however,
they have to meet the demands of the customer, which have been the object of a
written agreement between his employer and the customer. In principle, the
duties and obligations of those involved (the client - the employer - the
security guard) are clearly delineated. However, in the field, the
subcontracting relationship may result in each party’s **roles and
responsibilities becoming blurred**. This may **cause stress** for security
guards.

The tasks assigned may change as a result of unpredictable factors, unforeseen
events and additional demands. **This difference between tasks assigned and
tasks performed** can become a source of tension for guards.

**Check the following issues**

  * Ensure the roles, obligations and responsibilities of the employer, the client and the worker are clear. 
  * Make sure that any change in task is only decided and communicated to the guard by his employer
  * Explain to workers clearly that they can only report to the employer and that any direct requests by the customers to the guard must first of all be reported to the employer who will then discuss with the client.
  * Workers need to know clearly **what is expected from them**, **what their duties are** and **who they are accountable to**.
