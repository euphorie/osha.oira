Dogs can cause slight **injuries** such as lesions, light traumas (scratches,
bruises) and serious injuries such as bites, etc. They may also be a carrier
of microorganisms, viruses, proteins etc. that could cause **infections,
allergies or other health problems**.

**Risk factors:**

  * **The dog:** badly trained, too aggressive, sick, unpredictable behaviour.
  * **Bad dog handling:** several dog handlers for one and the same dog, different command patterns depending on the individual´s role, poor living conditions, food and monitoring of the health of the animal (vaccinations, regular medical check-ups).
  * **The dog-handler:** untrained or poorly trained as a dog handler, lack of compliance with basic hygiene regulations, lack of care for the dog, aggresive or unsuitable behaviour towards the dog.

Many national regulations provide the conditions for working with dogs. These
must be fully respected.

**Check the following issues:**

  * Dogs should be well trained and have a predictable behaviour.
  * Dogs should be housed and fed properly.
  * Dog should be vaccinated regularly.
  * A system of reporting any incidences with dogs should be installed.
  * Private security guards should be given [anti-tetanus injections.](http://www.hse.gov.uk/violence/security.htm)
  * Dog-handlers should be provided with information, instructions and training (obtaining the necessary certificates): risks and how to use the dogs, leashes and muzzles.
