Add a new behavior to link images on a risk

TODO: we still have lots of issues, please do not merge until these are fixed.


About image management

- [ ] I could not find in proto how to add a new image, I had to add the images manually
      (calling ``/++add++Image``)
- [ ] There is no clear way to manage uploaded images (editing, deleting, ...)

About the relation management:

- [ ] Only one relation can be picked at a time
- [ ] Removing a relation is not yet implemented
- [ ] When sorting the relations some injection happens (it should not)
- [ ] When sorting the relations the images are (apparently) not sorted,
      but reloading the page shows them in the proper order

Minor UI issues:

- [ ] The picker that opens in the panel has not the proper classes in the buttons
- [ ] We do not have a proper macro for the tabbed panels
- [ ] There is no page to display the image view
- [ ] In the navigation tree we do not have an icon for the image

Rest API issues:

- [ ] The ``related_images`` field is not serialized as ``null``
