    <p i18n:translate="disclaimer_other_websites">
        This tool contains links to other websites which are not are not under the
        control of the European Agency for Safety and Health and the organisations
        involved. The Agency and the organisations involved accept no liability in
        respect of the content of these websites.
    </p>

    <p i18n:translate="disclaimer_tool_information">
        The European Agency for Safety and Health at Work and the organisations
        involved will not be liable for any false, inaccurate, inappropriate or
        incomplete information stored in the OiRA tool or any other damages as a result
        of using the software.
    </p>

    <p i18n:translate="disclaimer_risk_coverage">
        Moreover, an OiRA tool is not intended to cover all the risks of every
        workplace but to help you put the risk assessment process into practice. For
        the OiRA tool to be fully effective it needs to be adapted to the context of
        your particular enterprise - some items might need to be added others omitted
        if they are not relevant.
    </p>

    <p i18n:translate="disclaimer_interactions">
        For practical and analytical reasons, the tool presents problems/hazards
        separately, but in workplaces they may be intertwined. Therefore interactions
        between the different problems or risk factors identified must be taken into
        account.
    </p>

    <p i18n:translate="disclaimer_coverage_liability">
        Therefore, EU-OSHA does not accept any liability for damages and claims in case
        a tool does not cover all risks of a given sector.
    </p>

    <p i18n:translate="disclaimer_printed_assesment">
        Moreover, the Agency and the organisations involved in the production of the
        OiRA tool do not accept any liability for damages and claims arising out of the
        use or inability to use the tool and the data stored therein. Similarly,
        EU-OSHA does not accept any liability in case of unavailability of the function
        of the OiRA tools to print the report, recording the risk assessment
        automatically generated by the tool. Therefore, the employer has to make sure,
        at any time, to be in possession of a printed, accurate and up-dated risk
        assessment.
