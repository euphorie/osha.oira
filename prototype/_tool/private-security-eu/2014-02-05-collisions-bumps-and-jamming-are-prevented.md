Collisions, bumps and jamming involve **fixed objects** (idle machinery,
tools, furniture, ...), or **moving objects** (machines placed in passageways,
vehicles, sliding doors, ...).

**Check the following issues through visual inspection of work areas:**

  * The circulation of people and vehicles should be properly organised (sufficient clearance must be allowed between vehicle traffic routes and doors, gates, passages for pedestrians, corridors and staircases).
  * Sufficient lighting should be provided (especially in stairwells and passageways).
  * Warning indicators should be installed when the risk of collisions, bumps and getting jammed cannot be prevented through other measures.
**Make sure the client informs you (the private security services company) and the private security guards about the risks and measures in place.**
