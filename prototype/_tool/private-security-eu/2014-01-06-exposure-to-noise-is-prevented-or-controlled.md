[Noise ](https://osha.europa.eu/en/topics/noise/index_html)is an unwanted
sound.

  * **Possible sources: **noise of the building’s installations, of machinery, of office equipment, detonation of ammunition during shooting practice, noise by human beings, crowds, ...
  * Noise can cause considerable **hearing damage**. The intensity (loudness) and exposure duration determine whether noise is hazardous. **Rule of thumb:** 'private security guards should be able to hear each other at one metre distance without raising their voice'.
  * Noise can also be a **source of annoyance and disturbance**, if it interferes with the job or if the job is very complex.

**Make sure the client informs you (security company) and the private security guards **about the risks and measures in place.

**Check whether the client:**

  * Has identified the source(s) of the noise + limit or reduce noise at source.
  * Ensures technical maintenance of workplaces, installations, ...
  * Provides work signs and PPEs.

Promotes working habits and behaviour that are not noisy.
