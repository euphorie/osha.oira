 <!-- Basic information -->
 <property name="title" i18n:translate="">Profile question</property>
 <property name="description">The basic architecture of an Online interactive Risk Assessment consists of: - profile questions (questions defining the company profile) - modules and potentially sub-modules - risks (positive statements) Profile questions are used to determine whether particular modules apply to the end user at all (OPTIONAL), or whether they should be repeated a number of times (REPEATABLE). Such questions are asked BEFORE starting the risk identification and evaluation. If the end-user does not confirm that an optional profile question is relevant (by ticking the box), then the corresponding module will be skipped entirely. If the end-user enters more than one option to a repeatable profile question then the corresponding module will be repeated the specified number of times.</property>
