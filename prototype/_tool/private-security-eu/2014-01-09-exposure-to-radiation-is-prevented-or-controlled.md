**SCANNERS / X-RAY MACHINES. **The use of equipment which generates radiation or working in areas close to radiation sources entails a risk of tissue being destroyed and/or irreversible effects on health.

**WHERE?**

  * Scanners at access control (airports, public buildings, ...).
  * The screening of mail, packages, suitcases, ...
  * Rounds in monitored or secured areas in hospitals (radiology, nuclear medicine departments), nuclear power plants, ...

**Make sure the client informs you (the private security services company) and the private security guards** about any radiation sources at the place of work, about the risks associated with them and the preventive measures to be adopted.

**Check the following issues:**

  * Warning signs should be placed in monitored/secured areas.
  * The instruction manual as well as any documentation relating to the use of the machine should be placed in close proximity to it.
  * The sources should be monitored (to prevent leaks).
  * Type-approved machines (marked CE) should be used or it should be made sure that the machines being used comply with European regulations.
  * Periodical technical inspection of the equipment should be ensured.
