URL extraction: Unescape URLs.

HTML snippets from HTML text editors are stored with their escaped HTML
entities. When we want to check the individual URLs used in that HTML snippet,
we need to unescape HTML entities in URLs, like `&amp;` to `&`, as used in
query strings, which are like all HTML content encoded to HTML entities.
