The tasks during a **bomb threat or other serious & immediate dangers (e.g.,
gas leak, flooding, ...)** should be clear to all private security guards.
This should be **tested and exercised during regular drills**.

The necessary measures must be taken and instructions given so that, in case
of serious, immediate danger which cannot be avoided, private security guards
may cease their activities and/or go to a safe place by immediately leaving
their workplace.

Any worker faced with a serious and immediate danger to his or her safety
and/or that of others in a situation in which it is impossible to contact the
relevant superior, should be able to take suitable steps to prevent the
consequences of such a danger.
